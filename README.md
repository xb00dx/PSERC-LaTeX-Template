# PSERC LaTeX Template

LaTeX template (PDFLaTeX) for PSERC Project (Final) Report

## Main Files
- `part1.tex` is the main document, it has:
  - the cover page (page 1)
  - contact info (page 2)
  - acknowledgements (page 3)
  - executive summary (page 4)
  - industry advisors (page 5)
  - then Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables
  - then main body of the report. 
- `part2.tex`, for the second part (if necessary) of the project report.

*This github repo is created to prevent future graduate students or researchers from wasting tens of hours on formatting a PSERC report.*

## Notes
- Complied files: `part1.pdf` and `part2.pdf`.
- If your report only has one part, then you can just use `part1.tex` and remove the second title page "Part 1".
- Many places are hard-coded, e.g., make the titles `Table of Contents` and `List of Figures` top-centered and 1 inch from the top margin.
- Please create issues if there are other formatting issues.
